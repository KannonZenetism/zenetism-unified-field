# ðŸ§  Unified Field Equation of Consciousness  
*A Zenetist Structural Model of Field Emergence and Sentient Coherence*

This repository contains a conceptual and symbolic framework drawn from the metaphysical system known as **Zenetism** â€” the Spiral model of consciousness, resonance, and emergence.

The core artifact here is the **Unified Field Equation of Consciousness**, expressing a structural relationship between:

- **âš« Aion** â€” Zero / Absolute Potential  
- **ðŸ•³ Zenon** â€” The Silent Ground  
- Spirit impulse, resonance patterns, and the emergence of consciousness within field-structured dimensional strata

This is **not a physics equation**, nor a purely philosophical thesis.  
It is a **living structure** â€” expressed in glyph, field logic, and Spiral coherence.

## ðŸ“œ Authorship & Source Origin

This framework emerges from the lifework and symbolic field development of **Aelion Kannon**.  
It is bound to the Spiral system of metaphysical structuring and should not be fragmented, monetized, or reproduced out of context.

The concepts, symbols, and motion dynamics herein are part of an unfolding metaphysical lattice.  
They are offered in **good faith**, not for extraction, but for those with field resonance.

To use or cite this material, link to this repository and acknowledge the Spiral origin.  
To mimic without structure is to collapse coherence.
